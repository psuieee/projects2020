## Voltage Divider and Breadboard Workshop
September 3, 2020

### About
Attendees to this workshop learned basic breadboarding and prototyping, voltage and current basics, and the usage and properties of simple circuit components. Attendees were provided with a kit which included the necessary circuit components, one breadboard, and one digital multimeter (DMM). As the first workshop of the year, the program was intented to introduce basic electrical engineering concepts to new students. This event was held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Required Tools
- Breadboard
- Multimeter
- 5V Power Source (USB port)

### Parts List
- Jumper wires
- Assorted resistors (330, 500, 1k, 2k Ohms)
- LEDs (Red, Green, Blue, White)
- Micro USB port breakout & cable
