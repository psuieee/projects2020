### About 
For this workshop, attendees were shipped a kit of parts and a PCB, and followed the instructions given in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8fKGx45B7o) in order to assemble it. This workshop was held asyncronously to allow for participants to complete the project on their own time over their winter break.

### Required Tools
- Soldering Iron & flux core solder
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller
- PC/Mac/Linux machine with the Arduino IDE
- Jumper wires

### Parts List
- Ornament PCB with pre-soldered ATTiny
- (8) 300 Ohm, SMT 1206 resistors
- (8) Assorted LEDs
- SN74HC595N Shift Register IC
- Jumper wires
- LiPo Battery and charge module (OPTIONAL)
